# Deploy Microsoft Edge for Windows 10 using Microsoft Intune

This article shows you how to automate Microsoft Edge deployment and policy configuration for Windows 10 by using Microsoft Intune.

>[!NOTE]
>This article applies to Microsoft Edge version 77 or later.

You can deploy Microsoft Edge to Windows clients that are managed in your company's Intune tenant by adding apps containing the Microsoft Edge installation files to Intune. Like any Intune apps, you can configure app assignments to require Microsoft Edge deployment for selected users or devices. You can also make the app available in the Company Portal for users to install when they want to.

Additionally, you can configure Microsoft Edge policies and settings by adding a device configuration profile. Using Intune to manage and enforce policies is essentially equivalent to using Active Directory Group Policy or configuring local Group Policy Object (GPO) settings on user devices. For more information, see [Configure Microsoft Edge for Windows 10 using Microsoft Intune](configure-edge-with-intune.md).

>[!TIP]
>For more information about deploying Microsoft Edge for macOS using Windows Intune, see [Deploy to macOS with Microsoft Intune](deploy-edge-mac-intune.md).

## Before you begin

- Review the information in [Add a Windows line-of-business app to Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/lob-apps-windows).
- To create apps for **Windows 10**, download the Microsoft Edge Enterprise installation **.msi files** from the [Microsoft Edge Enterprise landing page](https://aka.ms/EdgeEnterprise). The installation files use the build channel and processor architecture in their names, and will have names like **MicrosoftEdgeDevEnterpriseX86.msi** or **MicrosoftEdgeBetaEnterpriseX64.msi**.
- To create apps for **macOS**, download the Microsoft Edge Enterprise **PKG for macOS** from the [Microsoft Edge Enterprise landing page](https://aka.ms/EdgeEnterprise).
- Make sure you store the Microsoft Edge installation files in an accessible local or network location.
