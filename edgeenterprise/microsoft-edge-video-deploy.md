# Deploy Microsoft Edge to hundreds or thousands of devices

The video described in this article shows the steps to deploy Microsoft Edge to all your managed devices.

## About the video

Get a hands-on tour of how to deploy Microsoft Edge to your devices. Learn about Microsoft Edge package options for automated installation, how to deploy Microsoft Edge to Windows PCs using MECM (Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager), and steps to ensure all managed devices, including your phones and Macs, are provisioned with Microsoft Edge.

The new Microsoft Edge is based on Chromium and is compatible with both modern web standards, as well as your existing browser-based apps. Through a built-in IE Mode, you can browse Internet Explorer-dependent applications and sites without leaving the context of Microsoft Edge. As expected, Microsoft Edge brings enterprise-ready security, privacy, and manageability controls. All these strengths make Microsoft Edge the best browser for business across PC, Mac, and mobile devices.
