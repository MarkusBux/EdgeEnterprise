# Release notes for Microsoft Edge Beta Channel in 2020

These release notes provide information about new features and non-security updates that are included in the Microsoft Edge Beta Channel in 2020.

## Version 81.0.x.x: February 19

### Feature updates

- Collections is available. You can get started by clicking the Collections icon next to the address bar. This opens the Collections pane where you can create, edit, and view Collections. We designed Collections based on what you do on the web. If you’re a shopper, it will help you collect and compare items. If you’re an event or trip organizer, Collections will help pull together all your trip or event information as well as ideas to make your event or trip a success. If you’re a teacher or student, it will help you organize your web research and create your lesson plans or reports. Whatever you're doing on the web, Collections can help.

- Application Guard.  
- Updated the [3D View tool in Microsoft Edge DevTools](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/01/23/debug-z-index-3d-view-edge-devtools/), with a new feature to help debug z-index stacking context. 3D View shows a representation of the DOM (Document Object Model) depth using color and stacking, and the z-Index view helps you isolate the different stacking contexts of your page.
- Localized [the F12 Dev tools](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/02/04/localizing-edge-devtools/) in 10 new languages, so they will match the language used in the rest of the browser.
