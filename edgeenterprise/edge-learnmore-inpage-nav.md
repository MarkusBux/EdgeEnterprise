# Force in-page navigation to stay in IE mode

If you need more time to identify and configure all of the authentication servers used by your Internet Explorer mode sites, you can use this policy as a temporary solution to force all "in-page"* navigations from Internet Explorer mode sites to remain in Internet Explorer mode.

>[!NOTE]
>This article applies to Microsoft Edge version 77 or later.
